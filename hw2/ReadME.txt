This folder contains:
1. hw2_report_TingZhang.pdf
   This file contains the solutions to the theoretical questions and the report.
2. hw2_report_TingZhang.tex
   This is the latex source file for the report
3. hw2.py
   This is the source code for implementation in python. 
   There are three control flag defined in the code, which you can modify manually in the code.
   p---perceptron
   w---winnow
   testOn---train with test
   For now, p is set to 1, w is set to 1 and testOn is set 1. So it will do both perceptron and winnow with the known number of iterations for test.
   If testOn is set to 0, it will not run the testing part, but only do train and validation, and thus obtain the number of interations.
4. train.csv, validation.csv, test.csv
   These files are dataset for training, validation and testing. Please put them under the same folder as hw2.py

Please contact me if there any questions.
Thanks!
